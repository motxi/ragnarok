# Ragnarok (v1.0.0 Alpha)
osu!mania performance points (pp) calculator.

## Status
Currently in a very early development stage so you can expect anything to break at any time.  
Please report any glitches, bugs, etc. by submitting a new issue or by messaging to motxi#3019 on Discord.

## Building
Official builds will not be released until a *fairly* stable build is achieved (see TODO for more info).  
Even so, if you want to build it by yourself, Ragnarok only requires Visual Studio 2019 and .NET 5.0 Framework.  
Simply open the solution file on Visual Studio and click build.

## TODO
**Stuff left to do until stable release:**  
\- Organize UI  
\- Handle exceptions  
\- Support basic mods (+HT, +DT)  

**Stuff to do for the future:**  
\- Prettify UI  
\- Support other mods (+NF, +EZ, +HR)  
\- Custom input without beatmap  
\- Support old PP algorithm  
\- Export output  
\- Add more features? (rate changer, .osr parser)
